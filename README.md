## Project 

The common or white-tufted-ear marmoset Callithrix jacchus is a New World primate that inhabits the coastal rainforests of eastern Brazil. Its genome sequence will be useful for comparative genomics studies of primates. The C. jacchus genome is distributed over 22 pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes.

This assembly represents the principal haplotype of the diploid genome Callithrix jacchus. This is the VGP trio assembly merged haplotype data from the male and female. The alternate maternal and paternal haplotype sequences are in WGS projects JAALXQ000000000 and JAALXR000000000 respectively 


## Analysis material

This repository collects most customized scripts for genetic diveristy analysis for marmset project, including genetic diversity analysis, sequencing & polishing error measurement, run of homozygosity, and chimerism analysis.
